## Example for multilevel thresholding in image processing using maximum entropy criterion &amp; automatic thresholding criterion

<h3>About the project</h3>
Multilevel thresholding is a crucial technique in image processing, offering a versatile approach for segmenting images into distinct regions based on pixel intensity levels. This project introduces a new concept based on a research report to efficiently implement multilevel thresholding, leveraging a custom algorithm that combines adaptive thresholding and iterative refinement using Otsu's method. The algorithm aims to minimize intra-class variance and maximize inter-class variance, resulting in optimized threshold values for effective image segmentation. The report provides insights into the mathematical background of the algorithm, key code blocks, and showcases the results through a comprehensive visual representation, including the original image, the multilevel thresholded image, and a corresponding histogram. The iterative refinement process demonstrates the adaptability of the algorithm to different image characteristics. Overall, this report contributes to the understanding and application of multilevel thresholding for image segmentation in diverse fields of image analysis and recognition.
